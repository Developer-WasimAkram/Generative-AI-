### 5. RunnableBranch

 RunnableBranch is a control flow component in LangChain that allows you to conditionally route input data to different chains or runnables based on custom logic.functions like an if/elif/else block for chains â€” where you define a set of condition functions, each associated with a runnable (e.g., LLM call, prompt chain, or tool). The first matching condition is executed. If no condition matches, a default runnable is used (if provided).
